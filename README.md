Welcome to my first project in Python!

Follow along with me as I teach myself how to create a Tic Tac Toe game.

5/27/2024 - After watching several hour long videos, I have the basic concepts of Python. Combining it with my prior knowledge in Java, 
I've come up with the idea that I need to create a class that will keep track of the board and the moves that are acted upon the board.
It will be easier when I create an array, so that the moves can be tracked. For now, this is only the rough draft.

Next implementations:
    play() function
    has_winner() function
